# HR-Dashboard
In this project I imported a .csv file containing employee information into PowerBi and created an employee demographics page that gives the overall demographic outlook of the organization.
I then created pie charts and doughnut charts to visualize gender & racial diversity.
Finally I created an employee detail page that will provide you with all the important information about any employee with just a click.(Not actual people)
